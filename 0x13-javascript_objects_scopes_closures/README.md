# Project Title: JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

## Description
This project focuses on understanding and implementing JavaScript concepts related to objects, scopes, and closures. The tasks cover creating and manipulating objects, working with classes and inheritance, and implementing functions to achieve specific goals.

## Project Structure
The project includes multiple JavaScript files, each addressing a specific task:

- **0-rectangle.js:** Defines an empty class `Rectangle`.
- **1-rectangle.js:** Defines a class `Rectangle` with a constructor that initializes width and height attributes.
- **2-rectangle.js:** Enhances the `Rectangle` class to create an empty object if width or height is 0 or not a positive integer.
- **3-rectangle.js:** Adds a `print` method to the `Rectangle` class that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.
- **4-rectangle.js:** Extends the `Rectangle` class with additional methods: `rotate` and `double`.
- **5-square.js:** Introduces a new class `Square` that inherits from the `Rectangle` class.
- **6-square.js:** Extends the `Square` class with a method `charPrint` to print the square using a specific character.
- **7-occurrences.js:** Defines a function `nbOccurences` that returns the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list.
- **8-esrever.js:** Implements a function `esrever` that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.
- **9-logme.js:** Creates a function `logMe` that prints the number of arguments already printed along with the new argument value.
- **10-converter.js:** Implements a function `converter` to convert a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.

## Instructions for Running
1. Ensure you have Node.js version 14.x installed.
2. Install the `semistandard` package globally using `sudo npm install semistandard --global`.
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the `0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures` directory.
4. Run each JavaScript file using `./filename.js` (e.g., `./0-main.js`).
