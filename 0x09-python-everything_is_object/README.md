# Python - Everything is Object

This repository contains solutions for a project focusing on understanding Python's handling of different types of objects, including its specificity regarding variables, object types, mutability, and memory allocation.

## Background

The project delves into understanding fundamental concepts in Python programming, emphasizing:

- What an object is in Python
- Differences between classes and objects (instances)
- Distinctions between immutable and mutable objects
- Concepts such as reference, assignment, and aliasing
- Identifying identical and linked variables
- Identifying if variables point to the same object
- Determining object equality and identity
- Understanding mutability and immutability in Python
- Overview of built-in mutable and immutable types
- How Python passes variables to functions
