# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Overview

This repository contains a Python project focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The project delves into various fundamental concepts:

- **Class Definition:** Understanding class creation in Python.
- **Attributes and Methods:** Defining attributes and methods within classes.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction:** Using encapsulation and abstraction in OOP.
- **Special Methods:** Implementing special methods such as `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`.
- **Class Methods and Static Methods:** Exploring class methods and static methods in Python.
- **Instance Deletion:** Managing instance deletion and its implications on the program.
- **Class Attributes and Class-level operations:** Implementing class attributes and performing operations at the class level.
- **Comparing Objects:** Comparing objects based on specific criteria.
- **Creating Specific Instances:** Demonstrating the creation of specific instances.

## Files

This project comprises the following files:

- **0-rectangle.py:** Empty class definition for a Rectangle.
- **1-rectangle.py:** Defines a Rectangle class with private attributes and properties.
- **2-rectangle.py:** Enhances the Rectangle class with area and perimeter calculations.
- **3-rectangle.py:** Adds string representation for the Rectangle object.
- **4-rectangle.py:** Implements the ability to recreate instances using `eval()` from the string representation.
- **5-rectangle.py:** Detects instance deletion and displays a message upon deletion.
- **6-rectangle.py:** Tracks the number of instances and includes a message on instance deletion.
- **7-rectangle.py:** Adds flexibility to choose the print symbol for rectangle representation.
- **8-rectangle.py:** Implements comparison between rectangles based on their area.
- **9-rectangle.py:** Introduces a class method to create a square instance.
