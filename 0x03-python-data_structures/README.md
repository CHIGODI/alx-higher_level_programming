# Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating the use of lists, tuples, and various data structures in Python programming. The scripts cover a range of functionalities, from handling lists and tuples to implementing specific operations without using built-in functions.

## Contents

The repository includes solutions to the following tasks:

1. **Print a list of integers**
2. **Secure access to an element in a list**
3. **Replace element in a list**
4. **Print a list of integers in reverse**
5. **Replace in a copy**
6. **Remove 'c' from a string**
7. **Print a matrix of integers**
8. **Add tuples**
9. **Return length and first character of a string**
10. **Find the max integer in a list**
11. **Identify multiples of 2 in a list**
12. **Delete an item at a specific position in a list**
13. **Code to switch values of 'a' and 'b'**

## Requirements

- Python scripts are written and tested using Python 3.8.5
- The code follows specific guidelines regarding editors, file naming, and style checkers as mentioned in the project description.
- C scripts are compiled using the specified Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.
- Functions in C are implemented based on the given prototypes in the 'lists.h' file.

## How to Use

Each script file addresses a particular task and can be executed independently. The `./main.py` or `./main` files contain sample code that demonstrates the functionality of the functions or methods written in the respective Python or C scripts.

To run any specific task, execute the corresponding `main.py` or `main` file as follows:

```bash
./main.py
