# Python Classes Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It introduces fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, instance attributes, methods, data abstraction, encapsulation, information hiding, properties, and more. The project aims to impart a solid understanding of OOP principles in Python, emphasizing practical implementation and experimentation.

## Tasks
### Task 0: My first square
Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square.

### Task 1: Square with size
Write a class `Square` that defines a square with a private instance attribute: `size`.

### Task 2: Size validation
Enhance the `Square` class with size validation methods.

### Task 3: Area of a square
Implement a public instance method to calculate the area of a `Square`.

### Task 4: Access and update private attribute
Add properties to handle the `size` attribute with validation.

### Task 5: Printing a square
Implement a method to print the square with `#` symbols.

### Task 6: Coordinates of a square
Extend the `Square` class to include position attributes and adjust the printing method accordingly.
