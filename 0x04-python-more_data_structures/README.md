# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
This repository contains solutions to tasks focused on enhancing understanding and implementation of Python's data structures - sets and dictionaries, as well as working with lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Tasks

- `1-search_replace.py`: Function to replace all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
- `2-uniq_add.py`: Function to add all unique integers in a list.
- `3-common_elements.py`: Function to return a set of common elements in two sets.
- `4-only_diff_elements.py`: Function to return a set of elements present in only one set.
- `5-number_keys.py`: Function to return the number of keys in a dictionary.
- `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`: Function to print a dictionary by ordered keys.
- `7-update_dictionary.py`: Function to replace or add a key/value in a dictionary.
- `8-simple_delete.py`: Function to delete a key in a dictionary.
- `9-multiply_by_2.py`: Function to return a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
- `10-best_score.py`: Function to return a key with the biggest integer value.
- `11-multiply_list_map.py`: Function to return a list with all values multiplied by a number using `map`.
