# Python Network Projects

In this repository, you'll find solutions to various tasks related to network
programming in Python. These tasks cover a range of topics, from fetching internet
resources to making HTTP requests and working with APIs.

## About the Projects

This repository contains solutions to several projects focused on Python network
programming. Each project addresses specific learning objectives, including:

- Fetching internet resources using the `urllib` package
- Making HTTP requests, including GET, POST, PUT, etc.
- Working with JSON resources
- Handling errors and status codes in HTTP responses
- Utilizing the `requests` package for simplified HTTP requests

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each project.
Within each directory, you'll find Python scripts that implement the solutions
to the respective tasks. Additionally, there are README.md files providing further
details about each project and its requirements.

### Tasks Overview

1. **What's my status? #0**
   - Fetches the status of a URL using `urllib`.
2. **Response header value #0**
   - Displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable found in the header of the response using `urllib`.
3. **POST an email #0**
   - Sends a POST request with an email parameter using `urllib`.
4. **Error code #0**
   - Displays the body of the response and manages HTTP errors using `urllib`.
5. **What's my status? #1**
   - Fetches the status of a URL using `requests`.
6. **Response header value #1**
   - Displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable in the header of the response using `requests`.
7. **POST an email #1**
   - Sends a POST request with an email parameter using `requests`.
8. **Error code #1**
   - Displays the body of the response and manages HTTP errors using `requests`.
9. **Search API**
   - Sends a POST request to search for a user using a letter parameter.
10. **My GitHub!**
    - Displays the user id using Basic Authentication with GitHub API.
