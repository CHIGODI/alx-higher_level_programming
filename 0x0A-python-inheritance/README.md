# Python Inheritance Project

## Overview
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of inheritance in Python, emphasizing classes, subclasses, attributes, and methods.

## Tasks Overview
1. **Lookup:** Function to return available attributes and methods of an object
2. **My List:** Custom class inheriting from list, with a method to print a sorted list
3. **Exact Same Object:** Function to check if an object is an exact instance of a specified class
4. **Same Class or Inherit From:** Function to determine if an object is an instance or inherits from a specified class
5. **Only Sub Class Of:** Function to check if an object is an instance of a class inherited directly or indirectly
6. **Geometry Module:** Creation of a base class for geometrical shapes
7. **Improve Geometry:** Enhancement of the base class with an abstract method
8. **Integer Validator:** Addition of a method in the base class to validate integers
9. **Rectangle:** Creation of a rectangle class inheriting from the base geometry class
10. **Full Rectangle:** Enhancement of the rectangle class to implement the area method
11. **Square #1:** Class representing a square inheriting from the rectangle class
12. **Square #2:** Enhancement of the square class with modified print and string representations
